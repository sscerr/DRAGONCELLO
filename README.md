# DRAGONCELLO
DRAGONCELLO code solves the two-dimensional CR transport equation including a fully-anisotropic diffusion tensor (i.e., keeping the assumption of azimuthal symmetry but with orientation of the local magnetic field). This code is presented in: Cerri et al., JCAP 10:019 (2017). Refer to this paper if using DRAGONCELLO.

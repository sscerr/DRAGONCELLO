Here a light version of the DRAGON code to propagate a single species with fully anisotropic diffusion

DRAGONCELLO code is presented in: Cerri et al., JCAP 10:019 (2017). Refer to this paper if using this code.

See DRAGONCELLOdocumentation.pdf for installation and compilation guidelines.

### Galaxy ###

* Fully anisotropic diffusion tensor (depends on local magnetic-field direction)
* Axisymmetric version of a realistic Galactic magnetic-field model
* Sources with z and R profile 
* Constant energy losses
